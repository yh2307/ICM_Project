Description for the figures:
1.Dsitribution_Age/Disease/Gender:
Show the distribution of age/disease/gender in the datatset.
2. Avg_Volume_Disease:
Compared the average volume of each region between ADNI Group and Control Group.
3.Scatter Plot
Show the relationship of each data in the dataset.
4.Age_volume_linear/p:
Linear Regression of the volume and age.
Conclusion: Mammillary and Fibria area has significant difference among people in different ages and volume and age are not simple linear relationship. However, we can determine that age may lead decrease to the volume of limbic system.
5.Volume_Disease_p:
p_value of volume and disease:
find if there is significant difference of volume between ADNI and control.
The volume of most Limbic system has significant difference between ADNI Group and Control Group in the dataset. We assume that the volume of Limbic system is an important factor of ADNI.
